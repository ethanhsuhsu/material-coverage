# Contributing

The Material Coverage project is open for everyone to improve! We believe that
public input and active contributions are essential to high-quality scores and
solid project maintainence. If you would like to help out, here are some ideas
that could help improve the project:

* **Scoring feedback**: Found an issue or want to improve a certain score? We are
open to any sort of changes regarding our scores and are interesetd to discuss them further.

* **Design library reviews**: We are always open to have a new library reviewed
just copy the [template](reviews/review-template.md), review the
[scoring guide](scoring-guide.md) and start reviewing! We recommend you start with
libraries listed on the initial README page but we would enjoy a new library as well.

* **Repository improvements**: Our Markdown pages could use some improved
styling and better functionality. Or perhaps you have a better idea on how to
host the Material Coverage project. If you have any ideas for improvements, we
would be glad to rearchiteching the Material Coverage project all together! (well
not the scores, those will be the same...)

## How We Communicate
GitHub is amazing, so open a GtHub issue to passively describe any issues/features
or open a GitHub pull request to actively help out the project. We promise fast
feedback and review times 🙏🙏🙏
